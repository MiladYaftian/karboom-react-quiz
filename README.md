# Karboom React Quiz

As Instructed, Package management was done using yarn. json-server was used to create a db.json file for testing purposes and API calls were made using axios.

# Installation

1: yarn install (to install all dependencies)

2: You need to have two terminals open at the same time for the project to run properly:

- yarn json-server --watch src/db.json --port 3001
- yarn start

# IMPORTANT

Make sure the json-server is using the exact same version listed in the package.json file as otherwise there is a chance for logic to not work properly!
